 * \brief Generates a module from scratch using a simple algorithm

 * This examples tries to generate a module using a simple and primitive
 * algorithm. While scientifically completely unimpressive, it shows how

 * straightforward, however for clarity's sake the code is also commented to
 * further improve the understanding of what is happening exactly.
